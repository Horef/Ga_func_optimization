# Ga_func_optimization
What is possibly the least effective way to find a maximum of a function? With GAs!
I have actually built the algorithm in such a way that you can actually find points where function equals to any value (check comments).

## The Algorithm
Rhe algorithm is actually pretty simple, and works in a following way:
