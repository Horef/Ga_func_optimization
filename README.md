# Ga_func_optimization
What is possibly the least effective way to find a maximum of a function? With GAs!

I have actually built the algorithm in such a way that you can actually find points where function equals to any value (check comments in the code).
Please keep in mind, however, that this code (in the way it is currently implemented) **will only work for scalar functions**.

If you wish to use it for vector functions, you need to create an intermediate utility function which will convert the output vector to a single number.

## The Algorithm
The algorithm is actually pretty simple, and works in a following way:
